                  I would like to share my experience. My mom was admitted for a
                  cataract operation last month. Dr. Raghu took great care and
                  performed the surgery without any complications. The admission
                  and discharge process was smooth, and I will be recommending
                  him to my friends and neighbors

                my Dad starting from the entrance to the surgical ward. And the
                management staff were supportive, especially thanks to Mosses
                and his team. Doctors as wellðŸ˜Š. Happy service.

        <p>I was taken care of like a family member here. Within a minute of admission my treatment started. And all the ward boys, management and doctors will take care of the patient as if somebody of their own has been admitted. I was operated for fracture near my knee. And due process was followed. The surgeon, Dr Harshith and the anaesthetist explained everything to me in detail before surgery and calmed me down. Dr Sunil led the surgery and what a doctor he is. Dr Lokesh is the best doctor here. My father and friends who accompanied me here were impressed with the service. Moses helped us a lot.
I am saying this because I had a terrible experience at Sanjay Gandhi hospital. I was in excruciating pain and Marigold came to my help. Will never forget the doctors'and staffers here.</p>
