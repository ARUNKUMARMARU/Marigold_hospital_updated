Many times due to neuropathy, patients may not experience the pain due to MI and may suddenly die giving no  chance to review. It is hence necessary to undergo preventive health check to know the  status of the heart function, ideally annually to make sure they are not prone for MI or if they experience it, they could give sufficient time to intervene."
